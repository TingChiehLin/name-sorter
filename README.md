### Decision Recording

At the beginning, I think how to read files by Javascript and then I found resources which are ``fs module`` are able to
resolve my issues. Next, I got stuck with sorting; thus,I spent a lot of time on searching examples from Google. Fortunately, Javascript has its own sorting method which you do not need to use complex algorithm, such as ```Quick Sort, Merge Sort or Bubble Sort``` 
Finally, I am able to use split, splice and join to get my expected results ðŸ˜ƒ.
